# Circle Calculus S1.4: Factors, Scaling, and Prime Coils

Status: draft scaffold with the first scaling theorem proved.

## Aim

This paper will connect multiplication, scaling, factors, invertibility, and prime-circle behavior inside `S^1`.

## Target Spine

- `CC-T0008`: `Circle.scale_invertible_iff_coprime`
- multiplication as repeated rotation or scaling
- scaling invertibility iff coprime
- factor structure through orbit decomposition
- prime rings as full-cycle systems

## Proved Core

`CC-T0008` is proved by `Circle.scale_invertible_iff_coprime`.

For every modulus `n` and multiplier `k`, the scaling map

```text
scale(n,k)(x) = k*x in C_n
```

is a bijection exactly when `Nat.Coprime n k`. In ordinary gcd language, scaling is reversible exactly when `gcd(n,k)=1`.

The Lean proof reduces scaling to left multiplication by `(k : ZMod n)`. Mathlib then supplies the two standard bridges:

- left multiplication is bijective exactly when the multiplier is a unit;
- `(k : ZMod n)` is a unit exactly when `k` is coprime to `n`.

## Dictionary Targets

- `S1-0001`: S1 finite circle core
- `CC-0105`: Scaling
- new factor entries as the proof model matures

## Notes

This paper is the immediate missing `S^1` theorem target after the already green finite-circle and winding spines.
